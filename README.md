# Minimaliffic theme for Bungloo

## About

* Tent is a [protocol](http://www.tent.io) that allows services including micro-posts like Twitter. It is different, however, in that it is distributed - no single company controlls everyone's data. You can run your own Tent server, or use a [hosted service](http://www.tent.is).
* [Bungloo](https://github.com/jeena/Bungloo/wiki) is a native Tent client app that runs on Mac, Linux, and possibly Windows soon.
* This is a CSS skin for Bungloo that is minimal and responsive.

## Installation

### OS X

Copy the Plugin.css file to `~/Library/Application Support/Bungloo/Plugin.css`.  
Copy the Plugin.js file to `~/Library/Application Support/Bungloo/Plugin.js`.

Since OS X 10.7 Lion, the `~/Library/` folder is hidden by default. If you want to save your own CSS file, open the Finder and choose Go → Go to folder… and enter `~/Library/Application Support/`, there you can create the Folder Bungloo, if it doesn't exist and copy the plugin file there. You can also open the Library folder by choosing the Library menu item that appear in the Go menu while pressing the Option ⌥ key.

### Linux

The paths for the plugins on Linux are more confortable:
 
Copy the Plugin.css file to `~/.bungloo/Plugin.css`.  
Copy the Plugin.js file to `~/.bungloo/Plugin.js`.
